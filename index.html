           My name is Max and I'm currently a junior attending Northeastern University, and I major in Data Science and Mathematics combined.
            My birthday is May 5th, 2003, and I'm from a town about 30 minutes south of Boston called Canton.
            In my free time, I enjoy both playing and watching basketball, as well as spending time with my friends. I also enjoy skiing a lot. My 3
        favorite basketball players to watch right now are:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Shai Gilgeous Alexander</li>
            <li>Jalen Brunson</li>
            <li>Nikola Jokic</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In the future, I want my website to include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>More ineractions for the user like buttons and different pictures</li>
            <li>Smoother coloring</li>
            <li>Some sort of graphical visualization</li>
        </ul>

        <p> <img src = "images/download.png" />
            
            I'm really excited to learn more about designing visualizations and websites for myself.
