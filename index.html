        <p> 
           My name is Max and I'm currently a junior attending Northeastern University, and I major in Data Science and Mathematics combined.
            My birthday is May 5th, 2003, and I'm from a town about 30 minutes south of Boston called Canton.
            In my free time, I enjoy both playing and watching basketball, as well as spending time with my friends. I also enjoy skiing a lot. </p>
